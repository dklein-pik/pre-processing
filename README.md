# How to run on the cluster

`Rscript submit_preprocessing.R` runs with config/default.cfg. 

## Settings

The current process uses the default cache system (`cfg$cachetype = "dev`) which uses data from the default cache which might have been generated by an older process.

This only works if the functions used in the input data generation are following the naming conventions for madrat-packages.

If you want to use a separate cache folder starting from scratch for your input data revision, set `cfg$cachetype = "rev"` in your config file (usually config/default.cfg).

Note that `cfg$revision` may not include characters, e.g. `cfg$revision <- "6.607test"` won't work. If you want to test input data generation for some local changes, set `cfg$dev`, e.g. `cfg$dev <- "my-test"`.


## Useful tools on the cluster
- `inputdata-comparedata` - Compares the content of two data archives and looks for similarities and differences. Wrapper for `madrat::compareData`. Expects paths to two input data archives
- `inputdata-commithist` - List all git commits between two input data archives for selected input data libraries. Expects paths to two input data archives, the first must be the older one.
