# How to run on the cluster

Rscript submit_preprocessing.R

runs with config/default.cfg. 

The current process uses the default cache system which uses data from the default cache which might be generated by an older process.
This only works if the functions used in the input data generation are following the naming conventions for madrat-packages.
If you want to use a separate cache folder starting from scratch for your input data revision, set `cachetype = "rev"` in the retrieveData-call.
